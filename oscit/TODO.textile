ProxyFactory

h2. TODO: later

0. Fix IP resolution (ZeroConf code):
   Understand how we can connect to the remote when we have resolved from ZeroConfBrowser
   and adapt Location to store the relative information.
1. RefCount locations (shared objects ?).
2. Merge 'Location *origin' with 'Mutex *caller_context' ?
  Location can be
  a. Remote Location ===> need lock
  b. Local context   ===> need lock if context is different
