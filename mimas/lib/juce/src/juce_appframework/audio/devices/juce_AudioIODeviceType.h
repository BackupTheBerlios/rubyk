/**
    Represents a type of audio driver, such as DirectSound, ASIO, CoreAudio, etc.

    To get a list of available audio driver types, use the createDeviceTypes()
    method. Each of the objects returned can then be used to list the available
    devices of that type. E.g.
    @code
    OwnedArray <AudioIODeviceType> types;
    AudioIODeviceType::createDeviceTypes (types);

    for (int i = 0; i < types.size(); ++i)
    {
        String typeName (types[i]->getTypeName());  // This will be things like "DirectSound", "CoreAudio", etc.

        types[i]->scanForDevices();                 // This must be called before getting the list of devices

        String deviceNames (types[i]->getDeviceNames());  // This will now return a list of available devices of this type

        for (int j = 0; j < deviceNames.size(); ++j)
        {
            AudioIODevice* device = types[i]->createDevice (deviceNames [j]);

            ...
        }
    }
    @endcode

    For an easier way of managing audio devices and their settings, have a look at the
    AudioDeviceManager class.
