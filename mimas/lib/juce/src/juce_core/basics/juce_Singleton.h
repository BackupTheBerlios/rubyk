/**
    Macro to declare member variables and methods for a singleton class.

    To use this, add the line juce_DeclareSingleton (MyClass, allowOnlyOneInstance)
    to the class's definition.

    If allowOnlyOneInstance == true, it won't allow the object to be created
    more than once in the process's lifetime.

    Then put a macro juce_ImplementSingleton (MyClass) along with the class's
    implementation code.

    Clients can then call the static MyClass::getInstance() to get a pointer to the
    singleton, or MyClass::getInstanceWithoutCreating() which may return 0 if no instance
    is currently extant

    it's a very good idea to also add the call clearSingletonInstance() to the
    destructor of the class, in case it is deleted by other means than deleteInstance()

    e.g. @code

        class MySingleton
        {
        public:
            MySingleton()
            {
            }

            ~MySingleton()
            {
                // this ensures that no dangling pointers are left when the
                // singleton is deleted.
                clearSingletonInstance();
            }

            juce_DeclareSingleton (MySingleton, false)
        };

        juce_ImplementSingleton (MySingleton)


        // example of usage:
        MySingleton* m = MySingleton::getInstance(); // creates the singleton if there isn't already one.

        ...

        MySingleton::deleteInstance(); // safely deletes the singleton (if it's been created).

    @endcode

    If you know that your object will only be created and deleted by a single thread, you
    can use the slightly more efficient juce_DeclareSingleton_SingleThreaded() macro instead
    of this one.

    This is exactly the same as juce_DeclareSingleton, but doesn't use a critical
    section to make access to it thread-safe. If you know that your object will
    only ever be created or deleted by a single thread, then this is a
    more efficient version to use.

    See the documentation for juce_DeclareSingleton for more information about
    how to use it, the only difference being that you have to use
    juce_ImplementSingleton_SingleThreaded instead of juce_ImplementSingleton.

    This is like juce_DeclareSingleton_SingleThreaded, but doesn't do any checking
    for recursion or repeated instantiation. It's intended for use as a lightweight
    version of a singleton, where you're using it in very straightforward
    circumstances and don't need the extra checking.

    Juce use the normal juce_ImplementSingleton_SingleThreaded as the counterpart
    to this declaration, as you would with juce_DeclareSingleton_SingleThreaded.

    See the documentation for juce_DeclareSingleton for more information about
    how to use it, the only difference being that you have to use
