Rubyk
-----

Rubyk is a patcher written in C++ for realtime signal processing.

History
-------

I started this tool for the show 'home'  (first showed in Arsenic, Lausanne, Switzerland in January 2008)
because I wanted to be able to write Ruby scripts inside a multimedia application. I never felt at home
in the purely visual patchers where you can get lost quite quickly if you create complex works.

Due to speed issues with the first prototype in Ruby, I decided to write the whole thing in C. As I quickly
felt like reinventing object orientation I thought it would be more natural to use C++. The project now uses
Lua for scripting for its speed and ease of integration but the name rubyk (Ruby Kontroller) was kept. In my
country (Switzerland) rubies are used in clockworks so Rubyk is also a reference to this tradition.

Design goals
------------

I made a lot of efforts so that writing new objects is very easy (look at the code for Print or Metro). This
makes the development/wrapping of new features very lightweight. All these efforts weren't made to the detriment
of speed which was my main concern with this tool (it was meant to run on mac minis in realtime !).
